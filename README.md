Scripts for article entitled "Plasma proteomic signature of brain structure in 4,997 subjects"

**association.R** the script performing linear regression analysis between proteomic data and brain structure measures of five different categories

**functionAnnotation.R** the script performing physical and multiple functional annotations for brain structure associated proteins, including chromosome distribution annotation, UKB category enrichment, tissue enrichment, cellular enrichment and biological process enrichment

**protein_strucutue_MR.R** the script performing forward mendelian randomization (MR) analyses, using protein as exposure and brain structure measures as outcome

**colocalization.R** the script performing colocalization analsis for eQTL of FUMA-mapped eGenes and pQTL for brain structure-associated proteins

**protein_disease_MR.R** the script performing forward mendelian randomization (MR) analyses, using protein as exposure and ten brain disorders as outcome

**Mediation_analysis.R** the script performing mediation analysis, using protein as exposure, latent protein-associated brain structure as mediator, latent mental health phenotype as outcome
